# Air Quality Analysis of PM₁₀ in Badagry, Nigeria 

This project analyzes ambient air quality in Badagry, a peri-urban area in Lagos State, Nigeria, by examining PM₁₀ (Particulate Matter with diameter ≤ 10μm) using geochemical data obtained through SEM-EDX analysis. The objective is to identify dominant airborne pollutants and assess the potential health risks in different environmental units — Market, Residential, and Traffic areas.


## Objective

- To explore and visualize the geochemical composition of PM₁₀ across different locations.
- To identify pollution trends and element concentrations using Python and `pandas`.
- To derive measures for environmental and public health solutions.


##  Dataset Overview

The dataset contains PM₁₀ concentration values (in weight %) of elements from three sample locations:
- **Market Area**
- **Residential Area**
- **Traffic Area**

Each sample includes elements like:
`Si`, `Mg`, `C`, `O`, `Ca`, `Na`, `K`, `Al`, `P`, `Mn`, `Pb`.


##  Tools

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Skills

-Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualizations.


## Key Findings

- **Traffic Area** recorded the **highest lead (Pb)** concentrations, indicating pollution from vehicles.
- **Quartz (Si)** and **aluminosilicates** (Si, Al, O) dominate the PM₁₀ across all zones.
- **Market Area** also had elevated levels of heavy metals, exposing traders and consumers to potential health risks.


##  Environmental Implications

The study confirms the presence of harmful airborne particles with geochemical signatures consistent with road dust, vehicular emissions and anthropogenic activities. These have known links to respiratory issues such as silicosis and heavy metal poisoning.


##  Recommendations

- Regular air quality monitoring in high-traffic and market areas.
- Public health awareness campaigns about PM₁₀ exposure.
- Implementing cleaner transport policies and environmental regulations.
